- [Contributing to Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
- [Creating an Issue or Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request)

## Setting up server and accessing app
1. Make sure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed (version 18 is currently required). You can run "node -v" in your terminal to see if what version (if any) you currently have.
2. From the terminal within your project folder, run "npm install" to install all dependencies.
3. You will need a Yelp API key for everything to work. The easiest way to do this is ask HibLaz for it and follow the instructions provided.
4. After your API key is set up, from the terminal within your project folder, run "node server.js" to start the server.
5. Go to http://localhost:8000 to try out this app!
